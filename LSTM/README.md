> *LSTM* networks.

* Notes:
    - Recurrent neural networks have loops in nodes, allowing information to persist.
    - RNNs shortcomings are persisting information over a long history. They are fundamentally 
        unable to learn relevant parameters.
    - LSTM netwoeks (LSTMs) are a special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependence.
